This is a collection of TODO items and ideas in no particular order.

### Testing

-> Test uffi-compat with more UFFI libraries.
-> Write more FOREIGN-GLOBALS.SET.* tests.
-> Write tests for DEFCFUN, FOREIGN-FUNCALL and DEFCALLBACK that
   exercise all possible combinations of argument types, preferably
   in an automated fashion (for inspiration, see
   <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/6130>). This
   would have found ABI bugs in CMUCL/SBCL not long ago and might help
   find more.
-> Write benchmarks comparing CFFI vs. native FFIs and also demonstrating
   performance of each platform.
-> Write more STRUCT.ALIGNMENT.* tests (namely involving the :LONG-LONG
   and :UNSIGNED-LONG-LONG types) and test them in more ABIs.
-> Run tests both interpreted (where it makes sense) and compiled.
-> Run tests with the different kinds of shared libraries available on
   MacOS X.

### Ports

-> Finish GCL port.
-> Fix the ECL port.
-> Fix bugs in the Corman port.
-> Port to MCL.
-> Port to SCL. Note: Its maintainer has offered to do a port. It might
   be a good idea to wait until CFFI-SYS is stable, though.

### Features

-> Make LOAD-FOREIGN-LIBRARY smarter. Eg: avoid the need to specify the
   full path to the library.
-> Implement CFFI-SYS:%CLOSE-FOREIGN-LIBRARY for all supported Lisps and
   implement a higher-level CFFI:CLOSE-FOREIGN-LIBRARY in accordance
   to whatever interface we come up with load-foreign-library.
-> Implement a declarative interface for FOREIGN-FUNCALL-PTR, similar to
   DEFCUN/FOREIGN-FUNCALL.
-> [Idea] add shortcurts (aliases) for types. Examples: :UINT, :LLONG,
   :ULLONG, etc...
-> Figure out how to portably define types like: time_t, size_t, uint32,
   wchar_t, etc... Likely to involve something like SB-GROVEL and possibly
   avoiding this step on known platforms?
-> [Lost Idea] Something involving finalizers?
-> Implement the proposed interfaces (see doc/).
-> Add the ability to specify the calling convention to the interface.
-> Implement CFFI-SYS:ERRNO-VALUE (name?).
-> Extend FOREIGN-SLOT-VALUE and make it accept multiple "indices" for
   directly accessing structs inside structs, arrays inside structs, etc...
-> Implement EXPLAIN-FOREIGN-SLOT-VALUE.
-> Implement :in/:out/:in-out for DEFCFUN (and FOREIGN-FUNCALL?).
-> Add support for multiple memory allocation schemes (like CLISP), namely
   support for allocating with malloc() (so that it can be freed on the C
   side)>
-> Extend DEFCVAR's symbol macro in order to handle memory (de)allocation
   automatically (see CLISP).
-> Implement byte swapping routines (see /usr/include/linux/byteorder)
-> [Lost Idea] Implement UB8-REF?
-> [Lost Idea] Something about MEM-READ-C-STRING returning multiple value?
-> Implement an array type? Useful when we're working with ranks >= 2?
-> Implement bitfields. To read: get the word, LDB it. To write: get the
   word, PDB it, put the word.
-> External encodings for the :STRING type. See:
   <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.cffi.devel/292>
-> Improve the type translator interface. See:
   <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.cffi.devel/313>

### Underspecified Semantics

-> (setf (mem-ref ptr <aggregate-type> offset) <value>)
-> Review the interface for coherence across Lisps with regard to
   behaviour in "exceptional" situations. Eg: threads, dumping cores,
   accessing foreign symbols that don't exist, etc...
-> On Lispworks a Lisp float is a double and therefore won't necessarily
   fit in a C float. Figure out a way to handle this.
-> Allegro: callbacks' return values.
-> Lack of uniformity with regard to pointers. Allegro: 0 -> NULL.
   CLISP/Lispworks: NIL -> NULL.

### Possible Optimizations

-> More compiler macros on some of the CFFI-SYS implementations.
-> Optimize UFFI-COMPAT when the vector stuff is implemented.
-> Being able to declare that some C int will always fit in a Lisp
   fixnum.

### Known Issues

### Documentation

-> Fill the missing sections in the CFFI User Manual.
-> Write a tutorial section. (In progress, see: "bits from a new tutorial"
   <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.cffi.devel/273>)
-> Update the CFFI-SYS Specification.
-> Generally improve the reference docs and examples.

### Other

-> Type-checking pointer interface.
