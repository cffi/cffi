# What

CFFI, the Common Foreign Function Interface, purports
to be a portable FFI for Common Lisp. It abstracts away the
differences between the API of the native FFI's of the various Common
Lisp implementations.

# How

The CFFI library is composed of a Lisp-implementation-specific backend
in the CFFI-SYS package, and a portable frontend in the CFFI package.

The CFFI-SYS backend package defines a low-level interface to the
native FFI support in the Lisp implementation. It offers operators for
allocating and dereferencing foreign memory, calling foreign
functions, and loading shared libraries.

The CFFI frontend provides a more comfortable, declarative interface
for defining foreign functions, structures, typedefs, enumerated
types, etc. It is implemented in portable ANSI CL making use of the
low-level operators exported by CFFI-SYS.

The CFFI-LIBFFI subsystem loads support for passing structs by
value. It requires [libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/) for that.

Please consult [the
manual](http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/manual/html_node/) for
further details, including installation instructions.

# Where

Please visit [Github](https://github.com/cffi/cffi/issues) for bug
reports, feature suggestions, the latest version, and to send your
contributions. CFFI also has a [mailing
list](https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/cffi-devel), and a
project page at [cffi.common-lisp.dev](https://cffi.common-lisp.dev/).

# Notes

### CFFI/C2FFI

CFFI/C2FFI is an ASDF-integrated mechanism to automatically generate a
complete CFFI binding from a C header file. It requires a CLI tool
called [c2ffi](https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi), but only for the
developers of the libraries, not their users. `c2ffi` is written in
C++, and it uses LLVM/Clang as the parsing library. It generates JSON
output that can be checked in into the repositories. CFFI/C2FFI uses
these JSON files to automatically generate a CL file that contains the
CFFI definition forms. The generated bindings mirror the C namespace
into an otherwise empty CL package as closely as possible. It means
that they retain the upper/lower case of the names, and it also
includes the `#define` macros as CL constants.

Until CFFI/C2FFI is properly documented, you may check out these
projects as examples:

[hu.dwim.zlib](https://github.com/hu-dwim/hu.dwim.zlib),
[hu.dwim.sdl](https://github.com/hu-dwim/hu.dwim.sdl), and
